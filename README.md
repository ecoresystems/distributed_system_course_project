## Description
Course project for distributed system 2019

## Dependencies
Python3, Flask, Perl 5, GETA

## Datasets
This demo use 2 data sets: US Financial News Articles in Jan, 2018 and Japanese Wikipedia data dump. The datasets can be accessed at:  
US Financial News Articles: https://www.kaggle.com/jeet2016/us-financial-news-articles  
Japanese Wikipedia: https://github.com/Hironsan/wiki-article-dataset

## Known Issues
The GETA can work in local enviornment but can not be called in a live server, probably due to path issue.  
Due to the huge data size, the system will not be functional if hardware memory is less than 4GB.
